These are just some scripts I made, [you can download the latest release at my site](https://4572.ddns.net/encrypt%20&%20decypt%20scripts%20V0.2.zip)

These scripts encrypt and decrypt files using the [Scrypt](https://www.tarsnap.com/scrypt.html).

If anyone wants to contribute additional scripts they are welcome to do so, you can contact me on Discord\(@socamkern\) or make a pull request\/issue on this repository. Thank you!
